## Julia versions of NumericalMethodsforEngineers programs

More or less equivalent Julia versions of the Fortran programs described in "Numerical Methods for Engineers" by I M Smith and D V Griffiths to Julia.

Finale realease for Julia v0.6. Will be registered as v1.0.0. Julia 0.7 support is part of NumericalMethodsforEngineers v2.0.0

No timeline is set to complete this work.

Moved repository under the PtFEM organisation
