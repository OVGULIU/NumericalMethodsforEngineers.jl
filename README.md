##Access to NMfE programs

These are the programs as described in "Numerical Methods for Engineers" by I M Smith and D V Griffiths.

Currently only being tested on Julia v0.4.5 and occasionally on v0.5-pre.

The intention is to have all functions translated from Fortran to Julia more or less directly ( to make it easier to follow the book) and have pure Julia versions, e.g. p_02_07_for.jl is the direct translation, and p_02_07.jl is the Julia version.

There is also a set of notebooks is a separate repository ( https://github.com/goedman/RobGoedmansNotebooks.jl/tree/master/notebooks/RobGoedman/NMfE )
