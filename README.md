##Access to NMfE programs

This is an attempt to translate the programs as described in "Numerical Methods for Engineers" by I M Smith and D V Griffiths to Julia.

Currently being tested on Julia v0.5.

The intention is to have all functions translated from Fortran to Julia more or less directly ( to make it easier to follow the book) and have Julian versions.

No timeline is set to complete this work.

Moved repository under the PtFEM organisation
